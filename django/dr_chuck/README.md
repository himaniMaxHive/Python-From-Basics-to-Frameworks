## Introduction to Dynamic Web Content
You can explore, how internet/protocol and everything works, behind the scene.
- [Introduction to Networking](https://do1.dr-chuck.net/net-intro/EN_us/net-intro.pdf)
- Protocol
- Web server
- Browser App
- Request
- Response
- HTTP verbs (Get, Post, Put, delete)
- socket

## Network Sockets 
Phone calls for pairs of application

### HTTP - HtperText Transfer Protocol
wandering through linked documents on the internet
- **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**
    - http:// -> protocol
    - data.pr4e.org -> host
    - /page1.htm -> document
- **HTTP**
    - The dominant Application Layer Protocol on the Internet
    - Invented for Web - to rretrieve HTML, Images, Documents, etc.
    - Extended to handle data in addition to documents - RSS, Web Services, etc.
    - Basic Concept: Make a connection - Request a document - Retrieve the document - Close the connection

**_Internet_ and _sockets_ were created in 1970's, _HTTP_ was invented in 1990 and is an application protocol that runs atop sockets**
- **Internet Standards**
    - The standards for all of the Internet protocols (inner workings) are developed by an organization
    - Internet Engineering Task Force - [IETF](www.ieft.org)
    - standarrds are called "RFCs"-"Request for Comments"

## Network Sockets
- **TCP Connections/Sockets**
"in computer networking, an ***Internet socket*** or ***network socket*** is an endpoint of bidirectional inter-process communication flow across an Internet Protocol-vased computer network, such as the Internet"
- **TCP Port Numbers**
    - A port is an application-specific software communications endpoint
    - It allows multiple networked applications to coexit on the same server
    - There is a list of well-known TCP port numbers
